This is a new submission.

The package includes large benchmark datasets in inst/extdata (approximately 47 MB) that are required to reproduce the computational results presented in the vignettes.

The non-portable compiler flag warning (-Wno-ignored-attributes) originates from the Windows toolchain (Rtools/GCC) and is not set explicitly by the package.
